hi there I'm William jumer this is episode 37 of the tutorial series Live where 3 from scratch in this episode I would like us to learn how to use a wizzywig editor in our Livewire application in this case we are going to use tricks a text editor is used to format the text for example in a blog application in the previous episode we learned about laravel folio and we also learned in the other episode about Vault today I want us to use both of them to be able to assist me in this episode I want us to go ahead and create a vault component and what we are going to do we are going to run the command PHP artisan make and in this case I want us to create a component using folio so I I write make folio and then the name of our component and I'm going to call it post I hit enter to create the component and of course as we had it in our previous episode it's being created inside this folder that we created which is called um Pages if you are following this tutorial series and you did not watch the previous series you can be able to just check the previous episode to the previous two episodes to get some perspective but obviously you need you need to install Live Wire you need to install folio and you need to install volt and also you need to create a layout file for you to be able to render this uh component as a full page component so let me open post. blade and we see what we have inside here as opposed to when we create a vault file this one only has the div and nothing

else so inside here I want us to add the PHP tag where we we will have our PHP code then I will close the tag like that and then we also need to import to use the the volt uh API so I'm going to pass in use function Live Wire and then volt and then I want to import some um par here and in our previous episode we used State and that is exactly what I want us to do in this episode so I want to state to have two properties so the first one is um title in a blog you will have title and probably the other property that you will have is a property called uh content or a body or something of that sort so let me call it content like that so we have declared two properties I want us now to go to our blade file but before we go to the blade file I want us to go to the tricks um website and be able to copy the CDN link for tricks we will open uh Chrome and what I'm going to do here is just to search tricks editor this first link that we get is a page for tricks and I want us to just view it on GitHub because that is where we have the documentation but actually you can see how the editor looks like so I click view on GitHub and then once we scroll downwards of course there are so many things that you can be able to come here and have a look but what I want to should do is to just copy the links so in this case we are copying the CSS and we also copying the the JavaScript links or the JavaScript tags and this one I want us to attach in our layout file because we will be extending the layout file so I'm going to components layouts app. bled and on top of whatever it is that we have here which is um the bootstrap let me just extend this such that it's a little bit more visible so on top of the script for bootstrap I want us to add a little bit more but let me add them to the header section I think that is the best place where you can be able to put them so I put the two of them there so we have the CSS link CDN link and then the JavaScript CDN link for tricks how you save that that and go back to our component and then continue with every other thing that I would like to do there so I open post. play. PHP and inside here I because we we are using it as an anonymous component that is what that that means we are using it in in um we using it in folio we also need to uh import the layout so in this case we can say x layouts do app like that so we can just wrap it in that and then of course even here we can be able to do the same I also want us to have the ATV directive so we have at volt and then at end volt if you do not like this sort of presentation you can still follow this episode using the Vault um component inside the Live Wire uh page the way we created in episode 35 or you can be able to just work it out in a normal liveware component so you will not have issues if you choose whichever way to do but these ones you will now declare them as properties in the way we have uh talked about previously so now inside here I want us to have a form so we are going to have form then we will close the form tag and then I want this form to have a submit method so I submit y full colum submit and then our method that you're submitting to I want to call it save and then inside this form is where we are going to have two inputs one of the inputs is going to be sort of a normal one so in this case I want us to have a div uh with a class of mb3 just to style it a bit I will close that div and then inside here I want us to have an input so input a type is a text because it's just a title and then we can have wire model and then for the wire model what you're going to have is um title cuz we have already set the property the class we can have it as form control form hyphen control like that I believe that is it I also want us to have a label for this input so label and it has a class of uh form a class of form label like that and then we have the name of the label so in this case we can call it title after that I'm going to just copy everything that we have here and have the next input in this case now we are going to call it a different uh thing so let me paste this one here and now here the title should be content and then while we are getting the content we will not be putting the wire model here so I'm not going to have wire model content because we are going to display whatever is that we have here using the tricks editor so what I'm going to do in fact even the type we are going to change to Hidden so in other words we do not want this input to be visible but we want the details that are supposed to be in this input to be displayed in our tricks editor so also another thing that we need to do we need to give it an ID so I'm going to just type here an ID so I just call it ID 22 of course the reason why I'm putting it somehow uniquely is because if if if you want if you have any other um editor or input that you're using the tricks editor within the same component then you will have a conflict of um of of of your your inputs so these IDs have to be unique so in other words you may even consider setting it above here but for now we are going to just leave it like that the other thing that we need to have because it is hidden we don't even need the class of form control we don't need it what the next thing we need is to give it a name you're going to call it content and then I also want us to give it a value and the value I want it I want us to set it to the value of um the content that we got from from our from our our our component in this case this functional API this content that we have here so what I'm going to do here I'm going to just pass in the content like that and now after doing that we need to also import now the tricks editor so what I'm going to do is just to say tricks tricks hyphen editor so that is the tag we going to use and I'm going to close it in a similar fashion and then we are going to reference this ID so what I'm going to put here is input and we are going to say ID 22 like that we can also be able to give it a class so class and what I'm going to have here is tricks content hyphen content so that is the class that you're going to give and now for us to be able to pass the data that is typed in inside our tricks Editor to the to the to this um value here or for us to set it to this value here we are going to use JavaScript to do that so I want us to be able to have some JavaScript uh script tags here we are going to have the script Tags I'm I'm going to close them like that and then inside here we can be able to have a constant and I want to name it tricks editor you can name it whatever it is that you want like that so the name doesn't really have an issue and then we are going to get this element here the one that we have an ID of um 22 so in this case we can say document dot get element by ID like that and then we are going to pass the ID that we have here so in this case what am I going to pass an ID of 22 like that after that then we can go ahead and add an an event listener so in this case we can just pass add add event listen listener like that and then of course the event listener is uh we are going to pass tricks hyen BL and what this one does it's one of um whatever is that we can be able to pass according to what we have here uh if we scroll downwards there are several things that we can be able to pass in our editor so for this blur is similar to whatever is that we have in live whereby if you if you blur your your input then whatever it is that you have after somebody has clicked elsewhere then that you be sent to the back end so in this case it will be set to whatever is that we have in our in our CL in in our API uh value above so you can see we have tricks change we have tricks initialize we have tricks Focus we have tricks BL so that is what I am passing here and then of course we can um pass our event and since we'll not be using it is it even necessary I think it's not very necessary but we can have it like that and then after that now we can pass if you want to set a property you want to give and this one we have not talked about anywhere if you want to give a value to a property inside Maybe maybe you're live wi class you can be able to do it directly from JavaScript and what we will be able to do we can say this do set just like that and then we will say which uh property are we targeting so we are targeting content the content property and then using JavaScript we can be able to set it so in this case we we will use this we will say tricks editor do get attribute so you get the value attribute like that then of course the attribute that you getting from this ID is um the attribute that we calling value so that is what we are going to get so here I'm going to pass value and just like that we are able to listen to and be able able to pass this value to our component now because we had a method called save I want us to handle that at the saving of this um post even though I will not handle it conclusively I will just handle it up to somewhere because we do not have actually a table that is called posts not unless I'm mistaken so we going to have function and then inside here we are going to maybe what I want to do is DD and what I want us to check if it has a value when we type in is what we have as content so I can say we can refer to it in a similar way in which we refer to when we are working with the liveware classes and and the blade component like that so I can say this content like that I can close that so that is what we want to D I want to see if once once we are able to visit the URL we can be able to have that now just to explain something or clarify something we have our file and it is inside pages so we do not need to create a route called post we can just reference post if there is no other route that is called by that name we will be fine so what I'm going to do is just go to post singular and then let us wait and see if it is going to load our post we are having an error it is saying an um unexpected identifier State let me check in fact the problem is just here because we needed to close this with a semicolon so let me do that and now we can save let us see if everything is okay and now we are able to load our tricks editor the only thing that I've forgotten to do is to have a button for submitting so that is the only thing that I need to have I give it I put it somewhere before we close the form tag so you're going to have button and I'm going to have it having a type of submit and then we can give it a class of um BTN BTN uh primary like that and then we can close it and have it like that and then maybe we can call it we can have there submit the name of the button what it you display to the user and so basically that is what we have so if I type in if I don't type in something and submit you can see we are having uh the quotation marks in in this case is nothing if I typee in something here and submit now you can see inside the div we are having some content that we have typed so basically you can go ahead and save but before we save let me just attempt also and do something about validation just to um in intensify the concepts that we talked about in previous episodes so again we can be able to do our validation here we can say validated this one is just a variable to store whatever it is that you're validating you can have uh this validate hyphen validate and remember there are many ways in which you can be able to validate I'm just choosing one randomly and then of course um inside here we can have a property called uh title title and we can set title to required I want us to do even more because the title we may want it to be having a little bit more characters so we can say minimum um 10 characters and then of course also for our content we have another property called content and this one we can say it's required so one cannot be able to hit this method successfully and submit without giving us content and I want us to have a minimum of U how many characters maybe let me say 30 to be easy for myself but you can decide to set um values that can be able to just give the end user some some uh effort to do the typing because in this case they are doing a post you do not want them to just do a one sentence post and submit so that you not be proper so once we refresh I wanted just to click have I handled validation no I don't think so yes let me handle validation so here we can have at error and then uh we can have title so the errors belonging to title at end error like that and then uh on top of that now we can have a span here the things that you have done severally with a class of text danger and then we close it like that and inside here we can be able to pass a message like that I'm going to save and I'm going to copy this also for the content so I'm going to copy and after the tricks editor below here so I'm going to have our error messages displayed and then here we have the value as the property as content so if I'm to refresh and attempt to submit again now you see it's saying the content field is required and the title field is required if I type something in the title maybe some short uh text and some short text also for the content and I attempt to submit now it says the title must at least be 10 characters the content field must at least be 30 characters so let me type a little bit more on on on on the title and a little bit more on the content I'm just typing gibberish and uh try to submit and I think as this one reached 10 characters and 30 characters I don't know let me attempt again of course it seems It's submitting yes you can see the errors have cleared so meaning everything is uh okay and now for us to be able to save I just I'm not going to save but what I'm going to do is I just say uh post uh create and then inside here we will pass validated and then of course you have to remember to ensure that you have imported post here so maybe you can say use uh app models uh post like that if it exists but since it's nonexistent in uh this example I'm just going to comment them out again then of course after that you can be able to return a social message and since it's something that we have done continually and repeatedly I don't think it's a must for me to go ahead and do that you can be able to check the previous videos and be acquainted with that thank you very much for following this tutorial up until
